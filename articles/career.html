                                    or even at the airport—a new Starbucks store has sprung up to sell its premium coffees and coffee accessories to a populace eager to partake. 
                                    With more than 400 retail stores and 26 major airport locations, as well as a thriving mail order business and direct sales to businesses such as Nordstrom, 
                                    Barnes and Noble bookstores, Delta Shuttle, and others, more than two million people drink Starbucks coffee each week.</p>
