                                <img width = "500" src="images/industry.gif" href = "industry">

                                <p>The success of Starbucks cafés has been good for coffee distributors all over the United States. 
                                    Why? Because Starbucks has given coffee a new cachet. All coffee. Not just the product sold by Starbucks 
                                    (which represents only a minute fraction of the coffee drunk in the country) but also the 80% sold in supermarkets—and all the rest.</p>
                                <p>What’s more, Starbucks’ creativity has set off a chain reaction of innovation in the once-sleepy industry. 
                                    Kraft’s Maxwell House now markets a slew of new brands, including Italian Espresso Roast, Rich French Roast, 
                                    Master Blend, and Colombian Supreme, and it has also successfully expanded its upscale mail-order business, Gevalia.</p>
                                <p>Coffee’s greater cachet has had a big effect on the bottom line. Ten years ago, only 3% of all coffee sold in the United States was priced at a premium—at least 25% higher than value brands. 
                                    Today, 40% of coffee is sold at premium prices.</p>
                                <p>Over the past decade, we have tracked the cachet of 39 categories of fast-moving consumer goods measured as the percentage of the product category sold at a premium over value brands. 
                                    We’ve found plenty of evidence of the Starbucks effect. When individual companies increase the perceived “premiumness” of a product through innovations in the product itself or the way it’s delivered, 
                                    the entire category can reap higher prices and profits.</p>

                                <h3>Starbucks Enters New Era of Growth Driven by an unparalleled Reinvention Plan</h3>

                                <p>In connection with its Reinvention plan, Starbucks introduced a framework for accelerated earnings growth over the next three years, 
                                    underpinned by enhanced comparable store sales growth, increased store count growth, continued margin expansion, and disciplined capital allocation.</p>
                                <p>“Starbucks is a growth company, and our accelerated expansion is a direct reflection of the expected returns from our Reinvention plan,” said Ruggeri. 
                                    “By making strategic and highly targeted investments to drive value for partners, Starbucks will also drive value for customers and shareholders, 
                                    while managing costs, improving margins, and elevating the Starbucks Experience for all stakeholders.”</p>
                                <p>From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025, Starbucks expects comparable store sales growth to be in the range of 7% to 9% annually, both globally and in the U.S., 
                                    up from the previous range of 4% to 5%. In China, Starbucks expects outsized comparable store sales performance in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, 
                                    as the market laps the severe impact of COVID-related lockdowns, with growth normalizing in the new range of 4% to 6% in fiscal 2025, an increase from the prior range of 2% to 4%, 
                                    reflecting an increased digital capability and confidence in the vast opportunity ahead in this key growth market.</p>
