                                <h5>Abstract</h5>
                                <p>This case explores the impact of technology on the consumer experience at Starbucks. 
                                    It starts with an inquiry about why consumers choose Starbucks stores, even when traveling abroad. 
                                    Consumer experience is a critical strategic goal for the company, and technology has become a driving force in enhancing it. 
                                    Starbucks uses technologies such as the Starbucks Mobile App, associated rewards and card systems, internet of things enabled machines in the stores, 
                                    blockchain technologies connecting stakeholders, and reinforcement learning technology to analyze all the data. 
                                    Students study the role of these technologies in customer experience and explore different order processes.</p>
                                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                                <p>An American tourist looking for a Starbucks coffeehouse in Amsterdam’s most popular shopping and dining district makes me think. 
                                    We are coming from the source of this company, and we should try local flavors instead of our usual Starbucks latte. 
                                    The Dutch are one of the top coffee consumers in the world. A Dutch consumes an average of 18.52 lbs. of coffee in a year (Bernard, 2020). 
                                    This coffee consumption is double that of an average American consumes. The Dutch also played a substantial role in the trade of coffee worldwide. 
                                    When Yemen, the origin of the coffee drink, banned exporting coffee in the early 1600s, the Dutch traders shipped away whole coffee plants to other countries. 
                                    The Dutch became the largest coffee supplier in Europe by the 1700s (Law, 1850). Amsterdam was the center of the coffee trade in Europe (Bell, 1937). 
                                    Given the consumption level and rich history of coffee in this country, I am sure that the Dutch developed unique and exciting flavors that we will enjoy. 
                                    These arguments did not deter my wife from finding a Starbucks location and giving her usual orders. She cannot give away her Starbucks coffee even if we are traveling abroad. 
                                    What makes this Starbucks coffee so valuable for its customers?</p>

                                <p>It wasn’t the beverage itself that was so groundbreaking, but rather the way it was made. 
                                    Typically, it takes a barista about 87 seconds and 16 steps to make the beverage. 
                                    But this one took only 36 seconds and 13 steps, meaning the same, great-tasting beverage can be delivered faster to a customer while also providing a smoother experience for the barista.</p>
                                <h5>More efficient coffee</h5>
                                <p>Currently, every 30 minutes, Starbucks store partners have to grind coffee beans, 
                                    batch it in paper filters and brew. They throw away anything that’s unsold each half hour to meet quality and freshness standards. 
                                    Starbucks serves more than 15 million brewed cups of coffee every month in the United States.</p>
